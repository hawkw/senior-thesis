While programming languages researchers have produced a number of languages with various qualities that promote effective programming, such languages often may not be used for low-level systems programming. The automation of memory management through garbage collection often limits the use of many languages for systems programming tasks.

Mnemosyne is a new functional programming language intended for systems programming, providing methods of ensuring memory safety at compile-time rather than at runtime. This report outlines the design and development of a prototype Mnemosyne implementation and provides an abbreviated specification for the language.
