Using \LaTeX\ to produce a professional-looking senior thesis can
be a daunting task. This work illustrates some of the more common
tools and features of \LaTeX. The PDF version of the thesis, together with
the heavily-commented {\tt .tex} source files used to produce it,
answer many questions commonly asked by
seniors concerning the final typeset thesis document.
