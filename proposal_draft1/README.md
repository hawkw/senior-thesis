Senior Thesis Proposal Initial Draft
------------------------------------

This is the final draft of my proposal from Computer Science 580. Please note that I have used the `minted` package for formatting source code snippets in `proposal.tex`. Thus, in order to compile that document correctly, your LaTeX build tool must be invoked with the `--shell-escape` flag. If you are using `pdflatex`, the flag must be passed _before_ the name of the file being compiled, as in `$ pdflatex --shell-escape proposal.tex`.
