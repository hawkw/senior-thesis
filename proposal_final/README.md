Senior Thesis Proposal Final Draft
------------------------------------

Please note that I have used the `minted` package for formatting source code snippets in `proposal.tex`. Thus, in order to compile that document correctly, your LaTeX build tool must be invoked with the `--shell-escape` flag. If you are using `pdflatex`, the flag must be passed _before_ the name of the file being compiled, as in `$ pdflatex --shell-escape proposal.tex`.

Since my bibliography is generated by BibLaTeX, it is necessary to run your preferred LaTeX builder once, invoke `$ bibtex proposal`, and then invoke your LaTeX build tool a second time. This must be done every time the bibliography changes.

If you have any issues, try invoking your LaTeX build tool an third time. LaTeX is like profanity: if it doesn't work, you're not using enough of it.
