% This is a sample BibTeX bibliography file, showing articles, theses, 
% proceedings, books and collections being cited
%
% Bibtex is fairly lax about capitalization, so AUTHOR, author, Author, are all
% equivalent ways to specify the author(s) of a work. Similarly, things can be
% in quotation marks or enclosed in "{...}" or sometimes just printed with no
% enclosing punctuation at all.
%
% Bibtex entries copied from the Web (even from the ACM Digital Library site) are
% often wrong, or badly formatted. PROOFREAD YOUR BIBTEX FILE!
%
% To force a word to be capitalized when BibTeX doesn't want to do it, put 
% braces around the first letter, like this:
%          {T}hird {I}nternational {C}onference on {C}omputer {G}aming
%
% For URLs, use the \url{...} command inside a NOTE item, e.g.,
%
%           NOTE = {\url{http://cs.allegheny.edu}. Accessed 1 April 2013.},
%
% (There is a url entry type; it does not display anything.)
