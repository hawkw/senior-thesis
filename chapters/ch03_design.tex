\chapter{Design Considerations} \label{ch:design}
This chapter demonstrates how to include short code segments,
how to include pseudocode, and a few other \LaTeX\ features.

% \section{Test Environment}
% Algorithm \ref{widgmin} (from \cite{Fiori:2013}) shows a high-level description of an
% algorithm. There are many options for the display of
% pseudocode; this uses the {\tt algorithm2e} package \cite{Fiori:2013},
% but there are a number of others available at the Comprehensive \TeX\ Archive
% Network (\url{ctan.org}). Using any of these
% other packages might require the additon of one or more
% ``\verb$\usepackage{...}$'' commands in the main {\tt main.tex} file.

%   * THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT ALGORITHM ENVIRONMENTS. HERE, WE USE   *
%   * THE "algorithm2e" PACKAGE, BUT YOU SHOULD LOOK TO SEE IF        *
%   * OTHER PACKAGES BETTER MEET YOUR NEEDS. REGARDLESS OF WHICH      *
%   * PACKAGE YOU USE, EXPECT TO SPEND TIME READING THE USER MANUAL   *
%   * AS THERE ARE USUALLY A LARGE NUMBER OF PARAMETERS THAT CAN      *
%   * SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE FINAL APPEARANCE OF THE ALGORITHM.     *

\section{Experiments}

% Figure \ref{javaprog} shows a Java program. There are many, many options for
% providing program listings; only a few of the basic ones are shown
% in the figure. Some thought must be given to making code suitable
% for display in a paper. In particular long lines, tabbed indents, and
% several other practices should be avoided. Figure \ref{javaprog} makes
% use of the {\tt listings} style file \cite{Heinz:2013}.
