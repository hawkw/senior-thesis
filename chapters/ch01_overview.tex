\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro} % we can refer to chapter by the label

The design and implementation of programming languages has been a major area of study for most of the history of computer science as a discipline. Since only a small fraction of software is implemented in assembly language, it seems reasonable to surmise that the quality of programming languages has a major impact on the quality of software in general. While many have observed that a great programmer can write good code even in a bad language\footnote{And inversely, that a terrible programmer can write bad code even in a good language}, we should note that individuals with such wizardly skill\footnote{Or frightening incompetence} likely fall far outside of the bell curve distribution of programmer ability. For a majority of software developers, programming languages likely have at least some impact on software quality.

%
% The purpose of this sample thesis is to show various \LaTeX\ formatting
% commands. Information about content should be obtained through consultation
% with the thesis readers and examination of past senior theses.
% There are no fixed rules governing the number of chapters or their titles---old
% senior theses and discussions with the thesis readers are the best resources
% for making such decisions.
%
% Usually, a chapter begins with a paragraph or two that serves as a
% sort of mini-introduction to the chapter. This is followed
% by numbered sections created with ``\verb$\section{...}$'',
% ``\verb$\subsection{...}$'', etc.
%
% \section{Motivation} \label{sec:motivation}
% The first paragraph in each section is not indented---that is a standard style
% that is enforced by the \LaTeX\ program. It should never be necessary to
% insert commands to force paragraph indentation.
%
% The thesis should avoid the use of second-person pronouns such as ``you''
% and ``your,'' as well as the use of imperative statements (implied
% second-person) such as ``Look
% at \ldots'' or ``Consider the following example \ldots''.
% First person (``I,'' ``my,'' etc.) is sometimes acceptable,
% but should be used sparingly. (This is an appropriate topic
% for discussion with the first reader of the project.) Contractions (``don't'',
% ``can't'', etc.) are considered informal and should be avoided. Common
% abbreviations such as ``math'' for ``mathematics'' or ``comp'' for
% ``senior comprehensive project''  are also informal and not appropriate
% in the final thesis.
%
% Figures illustrating complex or hard-to-describe concepts are essential.
% All figures should be fully explained in the text. For example,
% Figure \ref{latexprocess} shows the first step in processing a senior thesis.
% The user files consist of the main file, {\tt AllegThesis.tex}, and zero or
% more additional files ({\tt ch01.tex}, {\tt ch02.tex} in the figure). Not shown
% in the figure are image files, the bibliography, and other included
% components (the ``\ldots etc.\ldots'' on the left side of the figure).
% Typing the command {\tt pdflatex} with the main file name
% produces a number of additional files, including an {\tt .aux} file (with
% information such a label references and citations),
% a table of contents, or {\tt .toc}, file, a printable {\tt .pdf} file, and
% a number of others, depending on the document.
%

% \section{Current State of the Art}\label{sec:stateofart}
% There are multiple
% ways to create {\it italicized}, {\bf bold-face}, {\tt fixed-width}, and
% {\sf sans-serif} fonts, as well as combinations, e.g., \textit{\textbf{
% bold italic}} or \textit{\textsf{italic sans-serif}}. The \LaTeX\ source
% file for this chapter shows some of the ways to achieve these effects.
% It is customary to use fixed-width font for program constructs, e.g.,
% ``In the Java code accompanying the figure, {\tt n} stands for the
% number of generations to be simulated by the {\tt evolvePopulation()} method.''
% Variables in mathematical equations are normally rendered in
% italics, e.g., ``In the performance equation, {\it cpuTime} is
% the average time over fifty runs of the program.''
%
% %It is the privilege of the thesis author (in consultation with the
% %project supervisor and other readers) to decide on the best way to
% %organize the sections and chapters in the way that makes the most sense.
% %If the introduction begins with a motivating
% %anecdote, perhaps this is best followed by defining a few terms or mentioning
% %some major results that the reader should be aware of right from the
% %beginning. But
% It is important to get as quickly as possible to
% a concise statement of the {\it thesis}---the main question
% addressed by the project. This might merit a separate
% section of the chapter.
%
% \section{Goals of the Project}\label{sec:goals}
% This section could also be entitled ``Thesis'' or something similar.
%
% A formal thesis statement should be a
% %\emph{falsifiable} % COMMENT OUT THINGS THAT YOU MAY LATER WISH TO PUT BACK
% statement about
% the goal achieved by the project.  For a purely scientific
% project, this is the hypothesis being tested; it should be a
% \emph{falsifiable} statement, i.e., one that can be disproven through
% an appropriate experiment.
% For an applied programming project, it is usually a statement about
% the feasibility and correctness of the approach used and the advantages it
% has over other approaches, using suitable metrics.  For a survey or study,
% it is usually a statement regarding the need
% or usefulness of such a study, its intended audience, and so on.
%
% % COMMENTED OUT NEXT FEW LINES TO SAVE SPACE; MAY PUT THEM BACK LATER
% %Following the concise statement of the thesis, some of the details can be
% %expanded.
% %It is appropriate to
% %refer to some of the results in the introduction (which may
% %mean going back and adding them to the introduction once the
% %research is completed).
% %A senior thesis, or any research paper, is not a mystery
% %novel---there is no need to keep the reader in suspense about what
% %has been accomplished.
%
% \section{Thesis Outline}\label{sec:outline}
% The introductory chapter usually concludes with a ``road map'' of the upcoming
% chapters, e.g., ``Chapter \ref{ch:relatedwork} reviews a number of past approaches
% to the problem and summarizes their strengths and weaknesses. Chapter
% \ref{ch:method} outlines the method of approach used to establish the
% results.''
