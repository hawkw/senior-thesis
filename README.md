# Allegheny College Senior Thesis

This repository contains Hawk Weisman's senior thesis for the Department of Computer Science at Allegheny College, and related materials.

My senior thesis concerns the design and prototyping of Mnemosyne, a functional systems programming language with compile time memory management. The source code for the Mnemosyne compiler can be found in [this Git repository](https://github.com/hawkw/mnemosyne).

To build the senior thesis:
  + `$ pdflatex --shell-escape main.tex`
  + `$ pdflatex --shell-escape main.tex`
  + `$ bibtex main` (this only needs to be re-run if the references have changed)
  + `$ pdflatex --shell-escape main.tex`
  + `$ pdflatex --shell-escape main.tex`
